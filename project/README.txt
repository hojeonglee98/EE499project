The following files can be found in this repository:

data_scraping.ipynb
This is a jupyter notebook that contains code to scrape data form the web. This was used for a previous dataset that we ended up not using. PLEASE DISREGARD THIS FILE

ee499_final_project.ipynb
This file contains our main code. It reads the data (found in readData) and then does all of the training. The function at the bottom of the file performs training and then testing on the desired season. The rest of the notebook has code testing our other methods and models. We wrote all of this code ourselves, and referenced documentation on the sklearn website, but did all of the programming ourselves.

ee499_final_project_with_table.ipynb
This code contains the main final project, but without the last few days worth of work. It was a separated branch of the main file that Hojeong used to write the table algorithm. We did not merge the branches and instead just renamed the file and transfered its contents to the main file. PLEASE DISREGARD THIS AS WELL

/readData/data_dictionary.txt
This file contains the labels for the data found in the csv files with more description of what each column contains. This came from the Kaggle dataset we cite in our paper.

/readData/df_full_premierleague.csv
This is our dataset. We got this data from a Kaggle set that is cited in our paper.
